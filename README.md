# 🖥️ Underfetch

## Because who needs accurate system information anyway?

Underfetch is the system information tool you never knew you didn't need. It's like Neofetch, but with a twist of lemon and a dash of "who cares?"

### 🚀 Features

- Displays system information... sort of
- Blazingly fast\*
- Written in C# because why not?
- Cross-platform\*\*
- Guaranteed to make you question your life choices

\* _Results may vary. "Blazingly fast" is a relative term._
\*\* _If by "cross-platform" you mean "it might work on more than one computer"._
